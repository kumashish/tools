CMake is a cross-platform build script generator:
1. Configuration: CMake reads all the CMakeLists.txt files and creates an intermediate structure that determines the next steps (such as listing source files, gathering libraries to link, etc.).
2. Generation: Based on the intermediate output from the configuration stage, CMake generates platform-specific build files (such as makefiles on Unix, etc.).
3. Build: The generated build artifacts are used with platform-specific tools, such as make or ninja, to create the executables or library files.
